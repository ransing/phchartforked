# TFLearn Chatbot

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/5c4d8370752f4e78b1c5a9650e746299)](https://app.codacy.com/manual/elementzprojects/chatbot?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=elementzprojects/chatbot&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

This is a chatbot that I made using Natural Language ToolKit and TFLearn to respond to messages. There will be a discord bot integration soon.

## TensorFlow version
This script was designed with the verson 1.15.0 TensorFlow module which is reflected in the requirements.txt. Not all CPUs are supported by this version so the version 1.5.0 for Python 3.6.x is included. If you receive the error "Illegal Instruction (Core Dumped)" when the script tries to import TensorFlow, try the older version. - PMF
